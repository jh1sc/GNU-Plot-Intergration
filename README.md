# GNU-Plot-Intergration
I was, looking for graphing libraries for my nerual network, lots were found however they werent most light weight, and didnt have the customisation i would like to visualise data.
And while searching i found, a youtube video using gnuplot and c++, and it worked very well.
I just made it into a function so its possibly easier for people to use for their scenarios.
